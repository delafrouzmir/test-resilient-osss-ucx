.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoshfort\fP is a wrapper in the vein of mpifort that compiles
an OpenSHMEM program.  The wrapper hides implementation
details from the user.
.SH EXAMPLES
The command

$ oshfort -g -o foo.exe foo.f
.RE
.LP
compiles foo.f into the OpenSHMEM executable foo.exe.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The underlying compiler/linker invoked by this wrapper is determined
when the OpenSHMEM library is built.  To override, set the

environment variable.
.SH NOTES
The OpenSHMEM specification does not say anything normative about how
OpenSHMEM programs are compiled, linked and launched.  These wrapper
programs are supplied as part of the Reference Library for
convenience.
